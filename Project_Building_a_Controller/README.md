# Project Quadrotor Controller

In this project, you will implement and fine-tune a cascade PID controller for drone trajectory tracking. The theory behind designing the controller using a feed-forward strategy is detailed in the paper Feed-Forward Parameter Identification for Precise Periodic Quadrocopter Motions. The following diagram illustrates [the cascaded control loops of the trajectory-following controller](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/schoellig-acc12.pdf).
