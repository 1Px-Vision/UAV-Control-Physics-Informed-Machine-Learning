# Project Quadrotor Controller

In this project, you will implement and fine-tune a cascade PID controller for drone trajectory tracking. The theory behind designing the controller using a feed-forward strategy is detailed in the paper Feed-Forward Parameter Identification for Precise Periodic Quadrocopter Motions. The following diagram illustrates [the cascaded control loops of the trajectory-following controller](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/schoellig-acc12.pdf).

## Project description

This project has two parts: the first requires implementing the controller in Python, while the second involves implementing it in C++.

## Python Implementation

Based on the initial project from the FCND, our task is to control a simulated drone using Python to fly in a square trajectory within a backyard environment. The controller functionality should be implemented in the ````controller.py```` class.

Tuning the controller for this trajectory is challenging. Initially, it's difficult to predict the outcomes. The trajectory resembles something like this:

When the scenario successfully passes the test, you will see this line in the standard output:

## C++ Implementation

This section represents the more complex aspect of the project. While parameter tuning in Python was challenging, the complexity here is higher in order of magnitude. The C++ implementation is just a small part of this demanding task. In this context, the simulator imposes more realistic constraints on the implementation, and issues can arise if these constraints are not handled correctly. Even more intriguing are the situations where the implementation is slightly off, not entirely incorrect. Udacity provides a seed project that includes the simulator implementation and placeholders for the controller code. The seed project‚Äôs README.md offers guidance on running the project and details the tasks required to implement the controller. There are five scenarios that we need to address. The simulator runs in a loop for each scenario and displays on the standard output whether the scenario has passed or not.

All the C++ code can be found in the /cpp directory. The more notable files include:

* **/cpp/config/QuadControlParams.txt:** This file holds the configuration settings for the controller. You can modify it while the simulator is running, and the simulator will update those parameters in the next execution loop.

* **/cpp/src/QuadControl.cpp:** This file is central to the project, as it contains the implementation of the controller. However, I should note that most of the effort required to pass the scenarios is spent on parameter tuning, rather than the code in this file itself.

### Scenario 1: Intro

In this scenario, we modify the drone's mass in the /cpp/config/QuadControlParams.txt file until it achieves brief hovering

### Scenario 2: Body rate and roll/pitch control

Now it's time to start coding. The GenerateMotorCommands method needs to be implemented by solving these equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\quad F_1 + F_4 - F_2 - F_3 = \frac{n_x}{l} = \tau_x & (1) \\
\quad F_1 + F_2 - F_3 - F_4 = \frac{n_y}{l} = \tau_y & (2) \\
\quad F_1 - F_2 + F_3 - F_4 = -\frac{n_z}{k} = \tau_z & (3) \\
\quad F_1 + F_2 + F_3 + F_4 = n_z = \dot{t}_z & (4) \\
\end{align*}
$$

F_1 to F_4 represent the motor thrusts, while ùúè_ùë•, ùúè_ùë¶, and ùúè_ùëß denote the moments about each axis. ùêπ_ùë° is the total thrust, ùúÖ is the drag-to-thrust ratio, and ùëô is the drone arm length divided by the square root of two. These equations are derived from classroom lectures. It's important to note a couple of considerations: for instance, in NED (North-East-Down) coordinates, the z-axis is inverted, which explains why the moment about the z-axis is inverted here. Additionally, during implementation, it is observed that ùêπ_3 and ùêπ_4 are swapped. In other words, ùêπ_3 in the lectures corresponds to ùêπ_4 in the simulator, and vice versa. The next step involves implementing the BodyRateControl method using a proportional (P) controller along with the moments of inertia. At this stage, the **kpPQR** parameter needs to be fine-tuned to prevent the drone from flipping. However, before doing this, it's essential to command some thrust in the altitude control, as thrust is no longer commanded in the GenerateMotorCommands. A suitable value for thrust is thrust=mass√óCONST_GRAVITY. Once this is completed, we proceed to the RollPitchControl method. This implementation requires applying a set of equations. A P controller should be applied to the ùëÖ_13 and ùëÖ_23 elements of the rotation matrix, which relate body-frame accelerations to world-frame accelerations.

$$
\begin{align*}
\quad \dot{p}_c = k_p (p_c - p) & (1)\\
\quad \dot{q}_c = k_p (q_c - q) & (2)\\
\quad \dot{r}_c = R_{13} & (3)\\
\quad \dot{r}_c = R_{23} & (4)\\
\end{align*}
$$

But the problem is you need to output roll and pitch rates; so, there is another equation to apply:

### Scenario 3: Position/velocity and yaw angle control

### Scenario 4: Non-idealities and robustness

### Scenario 5: Tracking trajectories
