# Project: Backyard Flyer

## Udacity Flying Car Nanodegree - Term 1, Project 1: Backyard Flyer

This project is part of the first term of Udacity's Flying Car Nanodegree program. The objective is to control a simulated drone using Python to navigate in a square trajectory within a backyard setting. The Python code utilizes the Udacidrone API to interface with the simulator, which communicates using the MAVLink protocol.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Program a quadrotor to fly autonomously in a box using Python.
* Use event-driven programming to program a quadrotor's flight computer.
* Become familiar with the DroneAPI for sending and receiving data from the drone.

### Project Overview

This project involves developing a state machine using event-driven programming to autonomously control a quadcopter within a Unity simulator. The Python code mimics the control operations typically performed from a ground station computer or an onboard flight computer. By leveraging MAVLink communication, this code can be adapted with minimal modifications to control a PX4 quadcopter autopilot.

#### Step 1: Download the Simulator
You can download the Udacity FCND Simulator from this [link](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases).
