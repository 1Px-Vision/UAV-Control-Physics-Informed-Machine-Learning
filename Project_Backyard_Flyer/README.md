# Project: Backyard Flyer

## Udacity Flying Car Nanodegree - Term 1, Project 1: Backyard Flyer

This project is part of the first term of Udacity's Flying Car Nanodegree program. The objective is to control a simulated drone using Python to navigate in a square trajectory within a backyard setting. You can download the Udacity FCND Simulator from this [link](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases). The Python code utilizes the Udacidrone API to interface with the simulator, which communicates using the MAVLink protocol.
