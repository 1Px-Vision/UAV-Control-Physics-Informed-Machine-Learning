# UAV-Control-Physics-Informed-Machine-Learning

Integrating Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) control and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to enhance UAV quadcopter control systems represents a novel approach. By combining DMD techniques with PINNs to solve the Riccati equation, this method is crucial for accurate UAV position estimation. It formulates the UAV control problem using physics-based constraints, ensuring that the learned models adhere to the physical laws governing UAV dynamics. DMD extracts fundamental dynamic modes from the data using a comprehensive dataset with UAV flight information such as position, velocity, and control inputs. These modes provide a reduced-order representation that captures the dominant UAV dynamics. This representation is then used within the PINN framework to solve the Riccati equation accurately. Integrating DMD and PINNs creates a powerful control strategy, enhancing position estimation accuracy and optimizing control performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this method in real-time UAV control scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in estimation accuracy and control stability compared to traditional approaches.
