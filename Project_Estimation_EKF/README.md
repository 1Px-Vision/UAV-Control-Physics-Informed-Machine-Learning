# Project 3D Estimation




Overview

The 3D Estimation project is the fourth project in the Udacity Flying Car Nanodegree program. In this project, the objective was to develop an estimator using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse data from various sensors (GPS, magnetometer, and IMU) on a simulated quadrotor to estimate the vehicle's state in three dimensions.
