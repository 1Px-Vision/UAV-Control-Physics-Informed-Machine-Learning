# Project 3D Motion Planning

It involves planning and executing a drone's trajectory in an urban environment. Building upon the event-based strategy used in the initial project, this work explores the complexities of path planning within a 3D environment. The code interfaces with the Udacity FCND Simulator using the [Udacidrone](https://udacity.github.io/udacidrone/) API.
